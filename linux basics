open      The open command lets you open a file using this  syntax: open <filename>
touch     You can create an empty file using the touch command syntax: touch <filename>
find      The find command can be used to find files or folders matching a particular search pattern. It searches recursively syntax:find folder1 folder2 -name filename.txt
in        The ln command is part of the Linux file system commands We have 2 types of links: hard links and soft links
gzip      You can compress a file using the gzip compression protocol named LZ77 using the gzip command. syntax:gzip filename
gunzip    The gunzip command is basically equivalent to the gzip command, except the -d option is always enabled by default  syntax:gunzip filename.gz  , gunzip -c filename.gz > anotherfilename
tar       The tar command is used to create an archive, grouping multiple files in a single file. syntax: This command creates an archive named archive.tar with the content of file1 and file2 : tar -cf archive.tar file1 file2
alias     You can create a new command, for example I like to call it ll , that is an alias to ls -al . syntax: alias ll='ls -al'
cat       Access the file syntax: cat file
less      
tail      The best use case of tail in my opinion is when called with the -f option. It opens the file at the end, and watches for file changes. Any time there is new content in the file, it is printed in the window. This is great for watching log files, for example syntax:tail -f /var/log/system.log
wc
grep      You can use grep to search in files, or combine it with pipes to filter the output of another command.

echo      The echo command does one simple job: it prints to the output the argument passed to it. syntax:echo "hello"
chmod     Every file in the Linux / macOS Operating Systems (and UNIX systems in general) has 3 permissions: Read, write, execute.

0	No permission	---
1	Execute permission	--x
2	Write permission	-w-
3	Execute and write permission: 1 (execute) + 2 (write) = 3	-wx
4	Read permission	r--
5	Read and execute permission: 4 (read) + 1 (execute) = 5	r-x
6	Read and write permission: 4 (read) + 2 (write) = 6	rw-
7	All permissions: 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) = 7	rwx
